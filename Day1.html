            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His mass–energy equivalence formula E=mc² has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</p>
            <p>Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and over 150 non-scientific works. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</p>
